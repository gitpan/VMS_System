This module lets you retrieve most of the info available via the system
service GETSYI, or the DCL lexical F$GETSYI. It also allows retrieval of
all the system parameters available from SYSGEN.

perl Makefile.pl
mms
mms test

to build and test the extension. If it tests OK, then

mms install

to install it. More info is in the POD documentation in the System.PM file.

VMS::System allows Perl programs to retrieve info about systems.  The
information it returns is pretty much equivalent to DCL's F$GETSYI
function, or what SYSGEN provides.

This module can't violate VMS system security in any way that DCL can't, so
if you can see something with F$GETSYI, you can see it with VMS::System.
If you can't in DCL or SYSGEN, you can't here, either.

WHAT'S NEW SINCE 1.03?

Added support for four neato-keen, but undocumented items--FAN_VECTOR,
THERMAL_VECTOR, TEMPERATURE_VECTOR, and POWER_VECTOR. They're only
available in VMS 7.1-1h1 and up, and only for AlphaServer 4000, 4100, 1200,
1000A, and 8400.
