Revision history for Perl extension VMS::System (ex VMS::SysInfo)

0.01  Tue Aug 26 16:46:40 1997
    - Copied from VMS::ProcInfo.

0.02  Fri Aug 29 09:09:14 1997
    - Fixed a problem with the tied hash and object interface where they'd
      always return info on the local node, but had the calling process'
      PID (!) marked as the node name.
    - Added support for getting system parameters with get_sys_parm
      functions. They return info for the local node only, unfortunately.

0.03  Thu Sep 04 09:09:14 1997
    - Fixed a bug in the bit_test macro--bitwise and is &, not &&. D'oh!

0.04  Tue Sep 16 10:14:20 1997
    - Added a bunch more system parameters. All of the non-SPECIAL ones
      from Appendix J of the System Manager's manual, actually.

0.05  Tue Sep 16 16:00:01 1997
    - Added in the SPECIAL parameters from Appendix J
    - Added a bunch of #ifdefs to make it compatible with VMS 6.2

0.06  Thu Sep 18 16:00:02 1997
    - Added in a bunch of changes to get it to work on a VMS 5.5-2 machine.
      It still doesn't, but its much closer. (More patches as soon as I can
      get more time)

1.00  Mon Sep 29 11:51:00 1997
    - Tested it on an OpenVMS Alpha cluster system. Works just fine, so
      it goes in release

1.01  Fri Oct 17 11:20:00 1997
    - Found a bone-headed error in the one_info method, which made tied
      hashes and such broken. Dunno why it wasn't noticed in 1.00, but
      there you go. 
    - Some of the routines were using CODE: instead of PPCODE:.
      5.004_01 didn't care, but 5.004_04 does. Fixed to Do The Right Thing.

1.02  Mon Nov 10 16:50:00 1997
    - Renamed from VMS::SysInfo to VMS::System

1.03  Fri Nov 21 16:55:02 1997
    - Merged the _parm_ and _info_ routines into just _info_ routines.
    - Added the node_list function
